Class Projects
These are Python projects completed for class assignments during my time at Columbus State.
I chose the most complete programs and cleaned them up a little bit.
Keep in mind that I am still a Python novice so there are far better ways to accomplish the tasks that these programs perform. A big part of the design was to show progressive understanding through the class studies.
Thank you!
